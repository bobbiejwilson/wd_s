### Clone

You'll need to clone recursive this repo, not download the zip! (It includes other Github submodules and they won't be included in the zip)

Via CLI:

`git clone --recursive git@github.com:WebDevStudios/wd_s.git`

Via SourceTree/Tower:

Select "Recurse submodules"

### Getting Started

You'll need to change all instances of the names: _s.

1. Search for `'_s'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
2. Search for `_s_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _s` in style.css.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_s</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `_s-` to capture prefixed handles.
6. Search for `_S_` to capture class names.

OR

* Search for: `'_s'` and replace with: `'project-name'`
* Search for: `_s_` and replace with: `project-name_`
* Search for: `Text Domain: _s` and replace with: `Text Domain: project-name` in style.css.
* Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Project Name</code>
* Search for: `_s-` and replace with: `project-name-`
6. Search for `_S_` and replace with: `Project_Name_`

OR

Use Yeoman!

`npm install -g yo generator-wd-s' - Install Yeoman and the wd_s generator

'yo wd-s' - In the wp-content folder of a new project, follow the prompts and a new magically created wd_s install with your project name in it's place!
