## Manual Installation

#### Clone

**You'll need to clone recursive this repo, not download the zip!** (It includes submodules and they won't be included in the zip)

* Via command line / Terminal:

  `git clone --recursive git@github.com:WebDevStudios/wd_s.git`

* Via SourceTree/Tower:

  Clone normally, but select "Recurse submodules"

#### Find & Replace

You'll need to change all instances of the names: `_s`.

* Search for: `'_s'` and replace with: `'project-name'`
  * (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain
* Search for: `_s_` and replace with: `project-name_`
  * to capture all the function names
* Search for: `Text Domain: _s` and replace with: `Text Domain: project-name` in style.css.
* Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Project Name</code>
   * (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
* Search for: `_s-` and replace with: `project-name-`
  * to capture prefixed handles
